          When America talks about climate change, it's in the future tense. For other parts of the world, though, the gap between now and next has long since closed. It's time that we decolonize our environmental awareness and start demanding the same of the government.

       Why Haven't We Listened?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The global flow of information doesn't take place in a vacuum. Instead, access to media is distinctly tied to a country's wealth. In turn, colonialism dictates who we hear from on the global stage. In the context of the discussion surrounding climate change, that means that the countries with power aren't hearing from the countries without, which are also the most severely affected. This makes it easier to minimize just how severe climate change is and continue to push substantive legislative action off for later.

       So What's Going On?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The impacts of climate change go far beyond warmer weather. We're already watching increased rates of desertification, widespread crop failures, severe flooding, intensified droughts, and lengthened wildfire seasons ravage global regions already struggling under resource scarcities such as North Africa, the Middle East, and South-East Asia. These areas suffer uniquely under intellectual colonialism and often face poor representation in Western mass media sources. The countries' devastation tends to be both underreported and unduly attributed to preexisting political and economic woes by channels and newspapers most watched in America.

      <h2>
       Well, Why Do We Matter?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The overwhelming scientific consensus tells us that climate change is both real and anthropogenic, specifically pointing the finger at the fossil fuel industry. America is not only the worlds largest producer of crude oil, a key factor in escalating climate change, but also a global leader with a significant degree of influence over economic and political trends. What the United States does regarding climate change matters. So where do we, as individuals come in? The first step is decolonizing our own conversations around climate change and refusing to push it off as a pressing issue just because we haven't hit doomsday yet. After we do that, it's time to start paying attention to what policies are on their way to passing and who's supporting them. Check out Congress.gov for the most recent information. Finally, start being vocal about how urgent substantial action on climate change is to not only the United States, but countries that are left out of the narrative.
